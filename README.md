# ADS508_Project
---------------------------

This project is a part of the ADS-508 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.  This project explores the relationship of San Diego's demand for electricity and gas resources in relationship to variables such as weather patterns, population density, and vehicle registration.
